The PromptShots System to a Shared Task on Evaluating the Rationales of Amateur Investors (ERAI) @EMNLP-2022 https://sites.google.com/nlg.csie.ntu.edu.tw/finnlp-2022-emnlp/erai-shared-task?authuser=0.

The pairwise ranking code utilizes the InstructGPT language model (https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/ -- few-shot prompts on the `text-davinci-002' model) while costs within the OpenAI API free tier budget. Our submission on this track ranking 3rd on the maximal loss (ML) pairwise accuracy.

For an awesome list on prompts, please see https://github.com/thunlp/PromptPapers or other awesome repos around GitHub.

For the unsupervised ranking task, we utilized many financial pretrained models and (<a href="https://github.com/perathambkk/probabilistic-lexicon-classification/tree/4b4dc37ca16923bc57d7de9f81e19e9850f0d9d8">Bayesian-fittedüç¥</a>) lexicons. Then, we intuitively weighed them using the MaxEnt principle. We won this shared task competition track on maximal potential profit (MPP) pairwise accuracy ranking. I just forgot to flip the sign for the maximal loss (ML) pairwise accuracy ranking submissions as I didn't even look at the scores in the training set, just submitted.

PS. Our base submission, when using just the bayesian lexicon from the best submission, can score very similar (a little bit ~0.5% lower MPP) compared to the best submission. POS feature and tone features add only a little bit of performance. (I haven't reproduced the numbers to be aligned with the official shared task results so this is probably still roughly speaking with some comparable evidences.)
